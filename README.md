Lab Practice 1
1) Write a Program (WAP) to add two numbers and display/print the sum
2) Write a C program that takes two numbers as an input and print the average them.
3) Write program that takes 3 digit number as an input. Program should compute and display the sum of digits in a number.
4) Write a C program to print the sum of n natural numbers.
The sum of first 'n' natural no`s-
1+2+3+.....+n=n*(n+1)/2
5) Write a C program to print the sum of the square of n natural numbers. The sum of squares of first 'n' natural no`s-
1^2+2^2+3^2+.....+n^2=n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6
6) Write a C program to print the sum of the cube of n natural numbers.
The sum of cubes of first 'n' natural no`s-
1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+......+n^3=(n^2 * (n+1)^2)/4
7) Write a C program to convert a given number of days into months and days.
8) Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the keyboard. Write a C program to convert this temperature into Centigrade degrees.
[ C = (F â€“ 32) / 1.8 ]
9) The length & breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the keyboard. Write a C program to calculate the area & perimeter of the rectangle, and the area & circumference of the circle.
10) Two numbers are input through the keyboard into two locations C and D. Write a C program to interchange the contents of C and D.
(a) using third variable (b) without using third variable
11) If a three-digit number is input through the keyboard. Write a C program to reverse the number.
12) The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a C program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.
(Hint: 1 meter = 3.281 feet)
13) If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard. Write a C program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number.
14) Write a C program to find the gross salary of an employee
Gross salary = base salary + DA + HRA+Bonus
DA= 40 % of the base salary, HRA=80% of DA, and Bonus= 25% of HRA.
Ask user to enter the base salary only.
